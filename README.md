N-F (near field) high-resolution image focusing technique is proposed. With Millimeter-wave (mmWave) devices, near-field synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is widely used in automotive-mounted SAR imaging concealed threat detection. Current research is mainly confined to the laboratory environment, thus ignoring the adverse effects of the non-ideal experimental environment on imaging and subsequent detection in real scenarios. To address this problem, we propose an optimized Back-Projection Algorithm (BPA) that considers the loss path of signal propagation among space by converting the amplitude factor in the echo model into a beam-weighting. This algorithm is an image focusing algorithm for arbitrary and irregular arrays, and effectively mitigates sparse array imaging ghosts.
